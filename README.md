### Hi my name is Patüòä

I am a professional who is enthusiastic about <b>software development & technology</b>, has <b>strong business acumen</b> and am very good with <b>people</b> with skills in <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React</b> and exposure to <b>Salesforce admin, AWS cloud and AI technologies and Python</b>.
</br>
‚Ä¢	A reliable, honest, hardworking, and professional individual who is results focused and is willing to go the extra mile</br>
‚Ä¢	Comfortable working both autonomously and as part of a team</br>
‚Ä¢	Shows grit, determination and ingenuity when confronted by obstacles</br></br>
Beyond my programming skills, I also have experience in business management and analysis which has helped me to understand, not only how to work as a developer, but the needs from a business perspective. </br></br>

My intellectual curiosity drives me to be a lifelong learner who loves knowledge sharing and the development of both myself and others.
