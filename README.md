### Hi my name is Pat😊

I am a passionate and creative front end react developer and BI originally from Bangkok Thailand but now living in New Zealand
I have a background in business management, finance and Human Resources, but following my new career path in software development is what excites me and I can’t wait to start using my new coding skills to solve real world problems.

🥰 I love food, travel, racket sports and art

Sawatdee Ka 🙏
